Vande Sulabha Prasannam Dhyaayet Hridaya Pankajam","Prostrations to Thee, Chief perceptor with pleasing face.
Salutations to the One, who loves His devotees, the One who 
removes the scare of birth and death. Salutations to the world 
Teacher who bestows liberation. Salutations to the One who is 
very easy to please. I meditate upon Thee in the Lotus of my heart",
